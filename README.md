# Incident Detection Project
## Project Overview
### This Project was completed for the CS-116: Intro to Security course at Tufts University.
#### The purpose of this program is to analyze network packets for incidents. The program is correctly implemented to be able to detect a NULL scan, FIN scan, Xmas scan, Usernames and password sent in-the-clear via HTTP Basic Authentication, FTP, and IMAP, Nikto scans, SMB scan, RDP scan, and VNC scan.

##### Additional dependencies: base64


##### I think the heuristics used in this assignments to determine incidents are pretty decent because the functionality would be similar to a person reading live results through Wireshark.


##### If I had spare time in the future, I would investigate other ports that may be prone to incidents, not just the obvious ports.
